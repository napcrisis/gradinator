##  Motivation
This program was created during the 2 hours of suspense between SMU's Oasis portal's first release of our semester GPA and the next release of our actual grade components
Can't really imagine this to be very useful to many ppl though
## Problem
SMU's release the semester's GPA, for example 4.12, and you are left wondering how the grades sum up to 4.12? 
A+ - 4.3
A - 4.0
A - 3.7
B+ - 3.3
B - 3.0
B- - 2.7

## Installation
You will need java on your terminal. But thats it.

simply java Grade and enter your grade point and number of modules taken this semester. E.g. my result this sem is 18.7 and 4 modules taken.
If you enter an invalid gradepoint, like my friend tried to enter her GPA, it will only give you no possibility

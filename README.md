##  Motivation
This program was created under the 2 hours of suspense before SMU's Oasis portal release our actual grade. Before which they only give you the Grade point, which is a sum of your grades.  

## Installation
You will need java on your terminal. But thats it.

simply java Grade and enter your grade point and number of modules taken this semester. E.g. my result this sem is 18.7 and 4 modules taken.
If you enter an invalid gradepoint, like my friend tried to enter her GPA, it will only give you no possibility
